# Hamasisha Quotes

## Author

Njoki Kamau

## Description

The quotes published earlier are displayed in the carousel. Any new quote added is also added into the carousel. The user is encouraged to attach a theme to the quote for organisation purposes. Each quote is linked to its own like and dislike button. Each quote includes an author, a theme and the date it was published. The quote with the highest number of likes is also highlighted as the Quote of the day. 


This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.7.

In this quote application, the user is able to upvote or downvote on the quotes already published or she can add her own quote. If a quote is unwanted, one can also delete it. 

Below is the link to the deployed site.
